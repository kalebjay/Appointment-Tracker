# Appointment-Tracker
This is a program that tracks appointments and allows a user to create, delete, and modify data 
related to a the appointments. There is connection to a SQL database and prepared statements are used
to interact with the database. There are multiple files to establish the variables used in the
classes. There are also controllers and fxml files that create the GUIs that the user interacts with.
When a user makes changes in a GUI, the information is passed safely through the code and updated 
in the database. All reads are pulled from the database and anything written is updated in the 
database as well.
